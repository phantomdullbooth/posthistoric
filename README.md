## Reflections

**Wins:** 
* "I enjoyed working with a single page, and getting creative with how to change to different views." - Aegean  
* "Making users was a lot easier this time around, since we didn't use relational models." - Alyssa

**Struggles:** 
* "Making CSS animation that works over and over again on the same page. Also, Angular animations." -Addison
* "We did a lot of setup with our Trello board, but forgot about it a few days in. We probably could've used it more than we did." - Alyssa
